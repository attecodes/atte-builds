                After High School I went to UC Riverside and got a Bachelors in
                Computer Science. After that I joined ESRI, a big map based tech
                company. I was at ESRI for two and a half years where I worked
                on the ARCGIS Story Maps team and we were building a complex
                interactive story telling web application.

                During this time I started getting interested in houses and
                tools and all the different processes it takes to build a house.

                To tie everything together, I have realized that I have a curios
                brain that loves to learn new things and the theme of the things
                I like is building.

                Building to me is: taking a bunch of smaller components
                (physical or virutal) and creating a complex system where
                everything comes together. Building is creating useful solutions
                that can benefit others and I find extreme joy from this.

                I take pride in my work and I believe that the work you do is
                your signature so I would not ever want to do a half ass job.

                Thanks for stopping by, I am Atte a 27 year old and I created
                this website to have a place where I can showcase who I am and
                what type of work I am interested in.

                After High School I went to UC Riverside and got a Bachelors in
                Computer Science. After that I joined ESRI, a big map based tech
                company. I was at ESRI for two and a half years where I worked
                on the{" "}

                During this time I started getting interested in houses, tools
                and all the different processes it takes to build a house.

                To tie all my passions together, I have realized that I have a
                curious brain that loves to learn new things and the theme of
                the things I like is building.

                Building to me is: taking a bunch of smaller components
                (physical or virtual) and creating a complex system where
                everything comes together. Building is creating useful solutions
                that can benefit others and I find extreme joy in this.

                I take pride in my work and I believe the work you do is your
                signature so I would not ever want to do a half ass job.
